### README: Telegram Bot for Invoice Processing and Financial Tracking

---

#### **Overview**

Welcome to the **Telegram Bot for Invoice Processing and Financial Tracking**! This bot is designed to simplify your financial management by automating the extraction of invoice totals from images and seamlessly updating your Google Sheets with the extracted data. Whether you're managing personal expenses or tracking business finances, this bot is your ultimate assistant.

With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, the bot leverages **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** technology to extract invoice totals from uploaded images and integrates with **Google Sheets** to organize and track your financial data. Itâ€™s perfect for anyone looking to streamline their expense tracking process!

#### **Key Features**

- **Invoice Total Extraction**:  
  Upload an image of your invoice, and the bot will use OCR to extract the total amount automatically.

- **Google Sheets Integration**:  
  The bot updates your Google Sheets with the extracted data, organizing it by date and category. It ensures your financial records are always up-to-date and neatly formatted.

- **Dynamic Spreadsheet Management**:  
  Automatically creates new sheets for each month and sorts data in descending order by date.

- **Customizable Categories**:  
  Define your own categories (e.g., Groceries, Utilities, Entertainment) to classify expenses effectively.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Built-in error handling ensures smooth operation even if the OCR fails to detect the total or other unexpected issues arise.

#### **How It Works**

1. **Start the Bot**:  
   Use the `/start` command to initialize the bot. You'll be prompted to provide your name and define your expense categories.

2. **Send an Invoice**:  
   Use the `/send` command to send an invoice. First, specify the category for the expense, then upload the image of the invoice. The bot will extract the total and update your Google Sheet.

3. **View Your Data**:  
   Use the `/getsheet` command to get the link to your Google Sheet and view your organized financial data.

4. **Future Enhancements**:  
   Commands like `/totalcategory` and `/total` will allow you to calculate and view totals for specific categories or all expenses for the current month.

  - `python-telegram-bot`: For building the Telegram bot interface.
  - `gspread` and `gspread_formatting`: For interacting with and formatting Google Sheets.
  - `dotenv`: For managing environment variables securely.

- **Regex Pattern Matching**:  
  The bot uses regular expressions to identify and extract the total amount from the OCR output.

- **Google Sheets API**:  
  The bot dynamically interacts with Google Sheets to create, update, and format spreadsheets.
